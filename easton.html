<center> <h1> <a href=http://www.eastonct.gov/> My Hometown: </a> Easton, Connecticut </h1> </center>
<center> <h2> While living in Easton, I attended Joel Barlow High School which is actually
 in Redding, the town over.

<center> <h3> Easton is about an hour from New York City, three hours from Boston, and just
10-15 minutes from the ocean (if the Long Island sound counts as the ocean)

<center> <h4> Growing up in a rural area gave me the opportunity to enjoy nature to its 
fullest. My whole life I have loved the wilderness and have observed the outdoors during my 
free time. My love for nature is one of my many reasons for attending UMaine!
